      <a id="about"></a>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p> I am a student at <a href = "https://umich.edu" target = "_blank"> The Univeristy of Michigan </a> studying within the School of Information. Before starting at Michigan, I was born and raised in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancho_Palos_Verdes,_California" target = "_blank"> Palos Verdes, California.</a> I have always had a passion for learning new skills, reading, and discovering new hobbies; this is likely where my interest in technology and digital studies stemmed from at a young age. Throughout my years since leaving California, I have fallen in love with The University of Michigan, and all of Ann Arbor's eccentric offerings. <br> <br> Scroll through this page to find a little bit more about my academic and work expereinces, as well as a look into my new expereince with graphic design and my long-lived-love of food! </p>

      <h2> <a href = "education.html" target = "_blank">Education</a> </h2>
      <p>I am a member of the University of Michigan graduating class of 2020. Within the School of Information, I have participated in several extracurricular organizations, including Shei Magazine, <a href = "https://spoonuniversity.com/chapter/michigan"> Spoon University</a>, and Michigan Advertising and Marketing. <br> <br> Click the "Education" heading above to get a deeper look into my time at U of M!

      <a id="work"></a>
      <h2><a href = "work.html" target = "_blank">Work</a></h2>
      <p>After my freshman year at U of M, I worked as a Digital Bytes and Content intern at Bread & Butter, a boutique public relations firm in Los Angeles. Bread & Butter represents clients within the hospitality industry, including restaurateurs and hotels. <br><br>
      This past summer, I interned within the Domestic Digital Marketing department at Paramount Pictures in Hollywood. Besides having the amazing experience of working on an iconic backlot, I learned a variety of new technology-based skills, incuding slide deck creation, Tableau, Excel, and market analytics. <br> <br> Click on "Work" above to get a better glimpse into my work experiences! </p>

      <a id="graphicDesign"></a>
      <h2> <a href = "graphicDesign.html" target = "_blank">Design</a></h2>
      <p>The University of Michigan School of Information strongly encourages its students to engage in interdisplinary studies throughout the realms of social media, graphic design, user experience, social justice, data analysis, and other techno-social topics. During my senior year, I have been completing a graphic design course that focuses on consicely portraying messages through designs that have intended audiences with an end-user accessibility mindset. <br> <br>Click "Design" to see some of my preliminary works (more to come, and always improving!) </p>

    <div class="eats text">
      <a id="eats"></a>
      <h2> <a href = "eats.html" target = "_blank">Eats!</a> </h2>
      <p>One of my favorite free-time activities is exploring local restuarants and small-business cafes. When I studied abroad in London, I made a habit of finding new local restuarants to try out, and I have done so in all of the cities I have lived (Los Angeles, London, Ann Arbor). As a member of Spoon University at U of M, I was exposed to many unique local restaurants (one of my favorites being Miss Kim). I am hoping to continue this hobby/tradition when I move to Chicago post-grad as well! <br> <br> Click the "Eats!" link above to enter a gallery of some of my favorite eats! .</p>

Some inspiration: favorite foods, book and movie recommendations, questions or concerns, inspirational quotes, places to travel, and so on! I look forward to hearing from you! </p>
