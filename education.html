  <p> I am a current senior at the University of Michigan studying Social Media Analysis and Design within the School of Information. 
    <br> <br>  Before studying at the University of Michigan, I attended high school at Palos Verdes High School. In Palos Verdes, where I was born and raised, I participated in several on-campus and extracurricular activities. I was very passionate about school government, and was an active member of ASB (Associate Student Body) for the majority of my time at PVHS. <br> <br> 
    Throughout my four years at Michigan, I have met and been inspired by fellow students, friends, and professors, who have all encouraged me to be a more intellectually driven and academically focused person--forever and always, go blue.
